An evidence based symptom criteria for identifying heath care workers (HCW) for testing, based on the probability of positive COVID-19 test results, would allow for a more appropriate use of testing resources. METHODS: This was an observational study of outpatient COVID-19 testing of HCW. Prior to testing, HCW were asked about the presence of 10 symptoms. Their responses were then compared to their subsequent pharyngeal swab COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test results. These data were used to derive and evaluate a symptom based testing criteria. RESULTS: 961 HCW were included in the analysis, of which 225 (23%) had positive test results. Loss of taste or smell was the symptom with the largest positive likelihood ratio (3.33). Dry cough, regardless of the presence or absence of other symptoms, was the most sensitive (74%) and the least specific (32%) symptom. The existing testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of three symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough) was 93% sensitive and 9% specific (AUC = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.59 - 0.67). The derived testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of two symptoms (fever, loss of taste or smell) was 89% sensitive and 48% specific (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.71 - 0.78). The hybrid testing criteria consisting of any combination of one or more of four symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, loss of taste or smell) was 98% sensitive and 8% specific (AUC = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.73 - 0.80). CONCLUSION: An evidence based approach to COVID-19 testing which at least includes fever and loss of taste or smell should be utilized when determining which HCW should be tested.", "annotations": [{"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 141, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 286, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "outpatient", "locations": [{"offset": 414, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 425, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 589, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003371", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Dry cough", "locations": [{"offset": 900, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005334", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fever", "locations": [{"offset": 1129, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004417", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "shortness of breath", "locations": [{"offset": 1136, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003371", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "dry cough", "locations": [{"offset": 1157, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005334", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fever", "locations": [{"offset": 1328, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013651", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "loss of taste", "locations": [{"offset": 1335, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005334", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fever", "locations": [{"offset": 1520, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004417", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "shortness of breath", "locations": [{"offset": 1527, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003371", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "dry cough", "locations": [{"offset": 1548, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013651", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "loss of taste", "locations": [{"offset": 1559, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1694, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005334", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fever", "locations": [{"offset": 1735, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013651", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "loss of taste", "locations": [{"offset": 1745, "length": 13}]}]}], "pmid": 32396670, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1590176224892}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D004417", "disease@MESH:D013651", "disease@MESH:D003371", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D005334"], "journal": "Acad Emerg Med", "year": 2020, "authors": ["Clemency BM", "Varughese R", "Scheafer DK", "Ludwig B", "Welch JV", "McCormack RF", "Ma C", "Nan N", "Giambra T", "Raab T"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

METHODS: Defining epidemic nodes as areas that included both most fatalities per time unit and connections, such as highways, geo-temporal Chinese data on the COVID-19 epidemic were investigated with linear, logarithmic, power, growth, exponential, and logistic regression models. A z-test compared the slopes observed. RESULTS: Twenty provinces suspected to act as epidemic nodes were empirically investigated. Five provinces displayed synchronicity, long-distance connections, directionality and assortativity - network properties that helped discriminate epidemic nodes. The rank I node included most fatalities and was activated first. Fewer deaths were reported, later, by rank II and III nodes While the data from rank I-III nodes exhibited slopes, the data from the remaining provinces did not. The power curve was the best fitting model for all slopes. Because all pairs (rank I vs. rank II, rank I vs. rank III, and rank II vs. rank III) of epidemic nodes differed statistically, rank I-III epidemic nodes were geo-temporally and statistically distinguishable.

Then, online psychological counseling services and psychological assistance hot-lines were rapidly established by mental health professionals in medical institutions, universities, and academic societies throughout all 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in mainland China, which provide free 24-h services every day including weekends, as well as providing psychological self-help intervention systems and artificial intelligence (AI) programs for psychological crises intervention.", "annotations": [{"id": "111", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 4806, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "112", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 5141, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "113", "infons": {"identifier": "333278", "type": "Species"}, "text": "H7N9", "locations": [{"offset": 5147, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "114", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 5492, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "115", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 5509, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "116", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D045169", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS", "locations": [{"offset": 4629, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "117", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D004421", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "psychiatric symptoms", "locations": [{"offset": 4649, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "118", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depression", "locations": [{"offset": 4704, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "119", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 4716, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "120", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D016584", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "panic attacks", "locations": [{"offset": 4725, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "121", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depression", "locations": [{"offset": 4792, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "122", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 4909, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "123", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000275", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "depression", "locations": [{"offset": 4952, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "124", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D009440", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "neurasthenia", "locations": [{"offset": 4964, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "125", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 4984, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "126", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006998", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "hypochondriasis", "locations": [{"offset": 4997, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "127", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-2019", "locations": [{"offset": 5311, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "128", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 5479, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "129", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 5556, "length": 7}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Background"}, "offset": 6196, "text": "In public health emergencies, the public often presents varying degrees of psychological reactions related to the epidemic situation. If those reactions cannot be relieved in time, they are likely to lead to further irrational behaviors, such as the panic buying of materials in Beijing during SARS, the rush for salt during the Fukushima nuclear leak in Japan, and more serious violent behavior. Although the epidemic was in a rapid outbreak stage, some individuals seemed to remain unaware of the true danger of SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear whether there is any difference in psychological response between individuals who directly felt the threat of COVID-2019 (were quarantined or their acquaintance were quarantined) and people who were not directly affected by the epidemic. Anxiety and mood disorders are the most common mental health problems in the general population all over the world, and there are important connections between anxiety and depression and occurrence of viral diseases. However, the epidemiological data on the Chinese general population remain unavailable, and how to best respond to challenges during the outbreak is unknown. Therefore, determining the prevalence of anxiety and depression, as well as differences and associated factors among the public, is the first important step for implementing early targeted intervention, reducing the possibility of further irrational behaviors and helping people return to normal life.

For example, 39% the public expressed anxiety about avian influenza in France, 48% of the general public had anxiety-depression symptoms after over 1 year of Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, 73% of residents had low mood and 57% had irritability during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, 16% of the public felt anxious during the early stage of the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in the Netherlands, and the percentage of 'very' or 'fairly' worried people in the general population fluctuated between 9.6% and 32.9% during the swine flu outbreak in the UK. Possible reasons for these differences are as follows. First, the Chinese government took quick and strong measures to ensure citizens' sense of security and frequently disseminated situation updates of COVID-19. Rapidly sharing information about the epidemic is an effective way to reduce public panic. Second, people have a high cognitive level of COVID-19. The general population's level of knowledge about the disease plays an important role in reaction to an epidemic crisis. In our study, 77.3% of participants thought they had a higher level of knowledge about COVID-19, and the result is consistent with the knowledge test on COVID-19 (the total score was 20), on which 70.13% scored above 15. Third, China quickly established a psychological assistance system, and 40.4% of participants in this study had received psychological support or counseling. The system might be an effective way to relieve negative emotions of the public.

Our study showed the self-evaluated level of knowledge, not an individual's actual knowledge. We could not differentiate whether it is one's actual knowledge that was related with anxiety in this study, but Purohit et al. suggested that the perception of one's own knowledge is more strongly related to health anxiety than one's actual knowledge. Another reason might be that the participants had misconceptions about COVID-19 caused by false propaganda, rumors, and defamation. Misconceptions can provoke anxiety, such as one report that caused the panicked buying 'Shuanghuanglian' (a traditional Chinese herbal medicine) among the general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Lienemann et al. reported that during the H1N1 epidemic in India, media reporting of inaccurate information contributed to widespread anxiety, fear, and panic in the general public. We also found that a high level of depression was correlated with having no psychological support or counseling from the community/government agencies. The individuals who had depression symptoms instead tended to not seek help. Their perception of stigma and embarrassment and their preference for self-reliance were the most important barriers to help-seeking.

People who suffer economic loss have to bear the pressure of the loss and they also have to face the problem of how to recover the economic loss. Having poor health was associated with a high level of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic. Having poor health makes one more likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, especially according to the news report that the infection is more likely to infect older men with comorbidities and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases, such as ARDS. In addition, some people who need medical support, such as patients with chronic diseases or cancer, cannot obtain medical resources in time during the COVID-19 epidemic. A study reported that individuals who are able to maintain better health, even under stressful epidemic situations, are more likely to resist the consequent mental impact.

METHODS: We recruited 73 patients with COVID-19 [49 men and 24 women; average age: 58.36 years (SD: 14.31)] admitted to the intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from December 30, 2019 to February 16, 2020. Demographics, underlying diseases, and laboratory test results on admission were collected and analyzed. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: The non-survivors were older (65.46 [SD 9.74] vs 46.23 [12.01]) and were more likely to have chronic medical illnesses. Non-survivors tend to develop more severe lymphopenia, with higher C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, D-dimer, and hs-Troponin I(hs-TnI) levels. Patients with elevated hs-TnI levels on admission had shorter duration from symptom onset to death. Increased hs-TnI level was related to dismal prognosis. Death risk increased by 20.8% when the hs-TnI level increased by one unit. After adjusting for inflammatory or coagulation index, the independent predictive relationship between hs-TnI and death disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac injury may occur at the early stage of COVID-19, which is associated with high mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of previously reported cases of psoriasis onset, exacerbation, or relapse after HCQ treatment. METHODS: A comprehensive EMBASE and MEDLINE search of original studies examining adverse effects of HCQ treatment related to psoriasis was conducted. Participant demographics, and details of HCQ administration and psoriasis diagnosis were extracted from 15 articles representing 18 patients. RESULTS: Females accounted for a significantly larger number of psoriatic cases compared to males and unreported sex (n=14, 77.8% vs. n=2, 11.1% vs n=2, 11.1% respectively). Additionally, 50% (n=9) of the cases did not have a history of psoriasis prior to taking HCQ. Of the 18 patients, 50.0% (n=9) experienced de novo psoriasis, 27.8% (n=5) experienced exacerbation of psoriatic symptoms and 22.2% (n=4) had a relapse of psoriasis after HCQ administration. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ treatment may result in induction, exacerbation, or relapse of psoriasis.

COVID-19 is initiated by the attachment of the virus to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium and this causes sore throat. Currently, however, we do not know about whether the number of virus attached to the pharynx or respiratory epithelium will influence on the severity of COVID-19. Easily speaking, when you inhaled 10 viruses and when you inhaled 1000 viruses, will infection risk or the disease severity be same or different? Currently, this cannot be proved easily. However, considering the effectiveness of a mask that prevents respiratory infections, less exposure is likely to prevent infection by an indirect evidence. One previous meta-analysis showed that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of SARS: wearing masks (odds ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.40; number needed to treat (NNT) = 6, 4.54 to 8.03) vs. wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT = 3, 2.37 to 4.06). We can make a potential hypothesis: if 10 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat, this may be cleared by host immunity. However, if 1000 viruses were inhaled and attached to the throat, it should go through a fight between the virus and host immunity. If viruses are cleared by host immunity, the person can be free from virus, but if the viruses win, they may replicate exponentially within a relatively short time and will cause viremia in the blood. In this situation, we still do not know whether the degree of viremia (viral load) might be correlated to the degree of host hyperimmune response, or whether reduction of viruses in the throat, for example, using betadine mouth spray or gargles, could decrease the degree of viremia in blood.", "annotations": [{"id": "496", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011206", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "povidone-iodine", "locations": [{"offset": 19963, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "497", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011206", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine", "locations": [{"offset": 19980, "length": 27}]}, {"id": "498", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011206", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "betadine", "locations": [{"offset": 21754, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "499", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 20074, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "500", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 20124, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "501", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 20169, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "502", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D010608", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "sore throat", "locations": [{"offset": 20279, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "503", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 20445, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "504", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 20540, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "505", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012141", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "respiratory infections", "locations": [{"offset": 20705, "length": 22}]}, {"id": "506", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 20764, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "507", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014766", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "viremia", "locations": [{"offset": 21519, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "508", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014766", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "viremia", "locations": [{"offset": 21603, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "509", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014766", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "viremia", "locations": [{"offset": 21816, "length": 7}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Defense for COVID-19 in the pandemic era: 7 recommendations to rescue the patients from COVID-19 infection"}, "offset": 21846, "text": "Currently, inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and blocking angiotensin receptor 2 (AR2) is considered to be the key target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and COVID-19 therapy.

A recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spike (S) glycoproteins also uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans.. Although less discussed than ACE2, it was shown that CD209L (L-SIGN), encoded by CLEC4M, is also a receptor for SARS-CoV. In this study, CD209L was expressed in human lung in type II alveolar cells and endothelial cells, both potential targets for SARS-CoV and the large S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV might use both ACE2 and CD209L in virus infection and pathogenesis. In addition, Chan et al. demonstrated that individuals homozygous for CLEC4M tandem repeats are less susceptible to SARS infection and L-SIGN is expressed in both non-SARS and SARS-CoV-infected lung. They also showed that compared with cells heterozygous for L-SIGN, cells homozygous for L-SIGN show higher binding capacity for SARS-CoV, higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection, suggesting that homozygosity for L-SIGN plays a protective role during SARS infection. In summary, the first encounter of the virus with the host might be through binding to attachment receptors, such as these receptors, which might play an important role of infection for a large number of enveloped viruses by capturing, concentrating and transmitting infectious virions. Once a virus reaches its target cell, a cascade of events generally starting with the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with specific entry receptors and co-receptors is necessary in order to trigger the virus-cell membrane fusion.", "annotations": [{"id": "605", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "angiotensin-converting enzyme 2",

This situation can be assimilated by forest fire. If a first small fire by cigarette butts can be detected by hiker early (early COVID-19), it can be extinguished by small amounts of water (low dose steroids) easily. But if wild forest fires spread (persistent high fever, dyspnea) in the mountain without early suppression, it cannot be suppressed despite every effort by numerous fire trucks (long-term use of very high dose of steroids), and all mountains will be burned (destructed lung, requiring ECMO). There was one recent systematic review reporting that the use of steroids may be harmful to patients with COVID-19. However, this result should be interpreted with caution because the quality of the included studies is extremely low and they have many biases, many studies are missing and the included studies are not on the use of steroids vs. no use.

Zou et al. recently showed that systematic corticosteroids therapy in the first 3-5 days in severe patients could enhance oxygen saturation (SaO2) and arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)/inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2), but corticosteroids did not exert any intervention on survival of NCP patients complicated with both ARDS and shock or multiple organ injury.

Furthermore, bacterial superinfection is hard to detect and cannot be easily diagnosed. Symptoms of COVID-19 and bacterial superinfection may overlap. Data on the prevalence of bacterial superinfection in patients with COVID-19 are very limited. Influenza pneumonia is often associated with Staphylococcus aureus co-infection and can be especially virulent. Initiating empiric antibacterial therapy in adults with community-acquired pneumonia who test positive for influenza was recommended by recent clinical practice guidelines. Therefore, we suggest that according to the clinical manifestations of patients, if the accompanying bacterial infection cannot be ruled out, patients can take antibacterial drugs against community-acquired pneumonia, such as amoxicillin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones. Empirical antibacterial treatment in severe patients should cover all possible pathogens, deescalating therapy until the pathogenic bacteria are clarified.", "annotations": [{"id": "949", "infons":

Chloroquine and its metabolite, hydroxychloroquine, are antimalarial agents that have demonstrated antiviral effects on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Chloroquine had inhibitory effects for multiple RNA viruses in vitro. Chloroquine showed no antiviral or clinical beneficial effects in treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus infections and as influenza prophylaxis. A news briefing suggested that its use in more than 100 patients showed \"that it was superior to the control in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course\", but the data have not been published yet. A recent consensus document recommended chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for minimum of 5 days. Another study found hydroxychloroquine more potent than chloroquine in vitro. Based on these data, hydroxychloroquine for 4 days, 400 mg twice daily after a loading dose of 400 mg was recommended. A recent systematic review found no published studies in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily treatment seemed to have a beneficial outcome in a small French cohort. However, we should also be cautious in interpreting the results of hydroxychloroquine, because the current situation is just based on the in vitro studies and small number of case series. Also, the adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine should also be considered. In this situation, we think hydroxychloroquine should not be used as a routine treatment of COVID-19, but if the condition of the patients worsens despite the use of steroids and antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine can be used as a secondary drug.", "annotations": [{"id": "1084", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 41825, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1085", "infons": {"identifier": "694009", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV", "locations": [{"offset": 41991, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1086", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 42004, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "1087", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 42300, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1088", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 42915, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1089", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 43458, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1090", "infons": {"identifier": "11309", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza", "locations": [{"offset": 42221, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "1091", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 41771, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1092", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002738", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Chloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 41871, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "1093", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 41903, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1094", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002738", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Chloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 42025, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "1095", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002738", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "Chloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 42095, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "1096", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C023676", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "chloroquine phosphate", "locations": [{"offset": 42588, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "1097", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 42672, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1098", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D002738", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "chloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 42708, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "1099", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 42751, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1100", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D017963", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "azithromycin", "locations": [{"offset": 42945, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "1101", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 42961, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1102", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 43132, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1103", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 43282, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1104", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 43356, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1105", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D013256", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "steroids", "locations": [{"offset": 43494, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1106", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D006886", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "hydroxychloroquine", "locations": [{"offset": 43520, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "1107", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 41861, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1108", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D065632", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "chikungunya virus infections", "locations": [{"offset": 42185, "length": 28}]}, {"id": "1109", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011014", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pneumonia", "locations": [{"offset": 42387, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "1110", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 42906, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "1111", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 43420, "length": 8}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_2", "section": "Defense for COVID-19 in the pandemic era: 7 recommendations to rescue the patients from COVID-19 infection"}, "offset": 43588, "text": "Policy should be changed"}, {"infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Defense for COVID-19 in the pandemic era: 7 recommendations to rescue the patients from COVID-19 infection"}, "offset": 43613, "text": "Seventh, policy for the drug use should be changed to reduce the mortality of patients. In usual situation, the patient can visit the clinic frequently according to the condition. Therefore, steroids and antibiotics can be given timely based on the judgement of doctors. However, this pattern of examination, diagnosis and treatment cannot be done in this COVID-19 era. Doctors' prescriptions are surely important to diagnose and treat patients. However, as we mentioned above, patients are just waiting for recovery or deterioration until severe symptoms and no treatment is done in the meanwhile. If the patient is infected occur with COVID-19 and gets fever, and visit the different clinics, the treatment will not be standardized among doctors. If a doctor concerns for the fever and the nature of rapid deterioration in COVID-19, he may use steroids and antibiotics early, while other doctors may not. If so, we can make some guidelines for the practical use of antibiotics, steroids and hydroxychloroquine for the patients to use these drugs. These should also include the benefit and adverse effect for each drug. The policy we are proposing is to give these drugs to the patients freely, although the range of drug should also be more discussed. In Korea, the diagnosis of COVID-19 is being done by drive through. Our suggestion is to make another drive through place to give these drugs to the patients to avoid the dissemination of infection, because if the infected patient go to the hospital for the treatment, he/she can infect all other patients. Also, it will be good if the drugs are given to the patient who is visiting the screening clinic, for example, at the time of drive through diagnosis and explain in detail the benefit and adverse effect for each drug. And then, the doctor can check the result for COVID-19 and guides the patient for taking the drugs by phone calls. Also, the patient can take these drugs at his/her judgement. This concept is based on that (1) any treatment for COVID-19 has not been established, (2) even though the patient visits the doctor, the treatment patterns will be all different among doctors, (3) steroids have frequently been used in other mild diseases such as urticaria, (4) because we do not exactly know the presence or absence of secondary infection when the patient get fever, oral antibiotics for 3-4 days can be acceptable treatment in routine clinical practice. Further, (5) hydroxychloroquine can also be given to the patients and it can be recommended that if the patient's symptoms worsen despite the use of steroids and antibiotics, he/she can take hydroxychloroquine after recognizing all the adverse effect of the drug. But if the symptoms worsen, the patient surely visit the hospital as well.", "annotations": [{"id": "1153", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations":

In addition, there will be more other or conflicting evidences and publications regarding our opinions. However, we would like to remind of the basic principle for the treatment of patients again, but we often forget this: \"Do no harm\". We all should think deeply on what is harm and what is no harm. In addition, we would like to say again: \"doing something is better than nothing.\" in the acceptable level of clinical practice.

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which preppers consider a 'mid-level' event, and which many of them were well-prepared for, makes clear that scholarly attention to prepper's motivations and methods is both timely and valuable. Drawing from a three-year ethnographic research project with preppers, this paper traces the activity of a single bunker builder who has constructed a technically sophisticated private underground community. Supplemented by additional fieldwork, the paper argues that the boltholes preppers are building in closed communities built to survive the collapse of society, order, and even the environment itself, refract the seemingly irresolvable problems we are failing to address as a species. In the prepper ideology, faith in adaptation has supplanted hope of mitigation, making contemporary bunkers more speculative than reactionary and more temporal than spatial. The bunkers preppers build are an ark to cross through a likely (but often unspecified) catastrophe; they are a chrysalis from which to be reborn - potentially even into an improved milieu.", "annotations": [{"id": "2", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 207, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "3", "infons": {"identifier": "32644", "type": "Species"}, "text": "unspecified", "locations": [{"offset": 1162, "length": 11}]}]}], "pmid": 32292206, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1587181047244}, "accessions": ["species@32644", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Geoforum", "year": 2020, "authors": ["Garrett B"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Methods: Descriptive research method was used to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of the cluster cases of COVID-19. Results: Since the onset of the first index case on January 15, ten confirmed COVID-19 cases had occurred in the workplace, and the epidemic had spread from the workplace to 4 families, infecting 7 family members. The median age of 17 cases was 55 (19-79) years. All the 10 employee cases were males, and in 7 family cases, 3 were males and 4 were females. Of the employee cases, 8 worked in CW workshop and 2 worked in administrative office building. The median exposure-onset interval of all the cases was 4 (0-12) days, and the median exposure-onset interval was 4.5 days in the employee cases and 4 days in the family cases. The median onset-medical care seeking interval was 4 days in the non-isolated cases, 2.5 days in the cases with home isolation after onset, and 0.5 day in the cases with home isolation before onset. Conclusion: The clustering of COVID-19 cases was observed in this workplace in Tianjin, which affected 4 families. In the early stage of the epidemic, accurate and rapid blocking and control measures can completely prevent the large-scale spread of COVID-19.", "annotations": [{"id": "7", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 355, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "8", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 515, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "9", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 603, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "10", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1383, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "11", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1602, "length": 8}]}]}], "pmid": 32162858, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1587181047244}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Mar 12", "year": 2020, "authors": ["Zhang Y", "Su X", "Chen W", "Fei CN", "Guo LR", "Wu XL", "Zhou N", "Guo YT", "Dong XC", "Zhao Y", "Wang HW", "Pan Y", "Zuo LJ"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

This assessment is based on the cases of infection reported over time by health authorities in Wuhan and then at the national level, as well as the media in China and other countries. One of the most urgent priorities is to determine the degree of human-to-human transmissibility of the novel pathogen, and accordingly, this is where information is most urgently needed. We outline two possible scenarios in the Table  and find that the early evidence was most consistent with limited human-to-human transmissibility, however more recent data seem to be increasingly more compatible with scenario 2 in which sustained human-to-human transmission has been occurring. Determining the exposure profile among the recently confirmed cases would directly contribute to this assessment. Additional information on approaches to case identification and laboratory testing protocols in Wuhan and in other cities in China would also be informative. A separate priority is to identify the animal reservoir of this novel pathogen and any intermediary hosts, including potential supply chains of wild or game meat.", "annotations": [{"id": "267", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 14134, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "268", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 14393, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "269", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 14402, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "270", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 14630, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "271", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 14639, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "272", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 14763, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "273", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 14772, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "274", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 14097, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "275", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 14186, "length": 9}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Discussion"}, "offset": 15246, "text": "It is challenging to judge severity from the information available to date. We estimated the risk of death among hospitalised cases of around 14% (Figure 2). For both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, the risk of severe disease increases substantially with age and with the presence of underlying conditions. One other caveat with estimating severity is that there can be long delays between hospitalisation and death for infections that are ultimately fatal. For SARS in Hong Kong, the average time from illness to death for fatal cases was 24 days. This means that early estimates of the case fatality risk that ignore the potential outcomes of cases still in hospital are typically underestimates of the final severity profile. We accounted for that by only including cases that either died or recovered in our estimate of the hospital fatality risk. Given that the cases reported outside Wuhan have mostly not been severe, it would be reasonable to infer that there might be a large number of undetected relatively mild infections in Wuhan and that the infection fatality risk is below 1% or even below 0.1%.", "annotations": [{"id": "286", "infons": {"identifier": "694009", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV", "locations": [{"offset": 15413, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "287", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 15347, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "288", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D018352", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "MERS-CoV infections", "locations": [{"offset": 15426, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "289", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 15658, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "290", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 15668, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "291", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D045169", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS", "locations": [{"offset": 15710, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "292", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 15762, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "293", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "died", "locations": [{"offset": 16035, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "294", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 16270, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "295", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 16303, "length": 9}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Discussion"}, "offset": 16359, "text": "There are a number of limitations to our analyses.

With the rapidly galloping epidemic due to globalization and international travel, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on 11 March 2020, which is 72 days after the first official announcement of clusters of patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019 (day 1). As of 8 April 2020 (day 100), over 1.35 million people have been infected worldwide with nearly 80,000 deaths. In response, proactive infection control measures have been implemented in hospital settings.   In addition, non-pharmaceutical public health interventions including border control or closure, quarantine and testing of all incoming travelers or returnees, massive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for case detection, rapid contact tracing and quarantine, frequent hand hygiene, and later social distancing measures including school closure, home office, cancelation of all mass gatherings, later stay-at-home order, and cessation of all socioeconomic activities except essential services, were also adopted to various degrees and at different time points in different geographical areas to reduce the risk of community transmission. Many of these measures had been used for the control of community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (HKSAR) and other parts of the world.   However, the efficacy of community-wide masking of the population during these past epidemics or the present COVID-19 pandemic has not been clearly investigated. Unlike 2003 SARS which was generally manifested with high fever and progressive pneumonia with a mortality of about 10%, COVID-19 can be associated with very mild symptoms and a mortality of less than 4%. Thus subclinical or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 shedders may play an important role in perpetuating the pandemic.   We hypothesized that community-wide masking in HKSAR may break the chain of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the infectiousness of the subclinical virus shedders while also offering some protection to the susceptible population.", "annotations": [{"id": "60", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "locations": [{"offset": 1970, "length": 47}]}, {"id": "61", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 2019, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "62", "infons": {"identifier": "694009", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS related coronaviruses", "locations": [{"offset": 2064, "length": 26}]}, {"id": "63", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2422, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "64", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 2576, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "65", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 4065, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "66", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 4236, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "67", "infons": {"identifier": "11309", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza", "locations": [{"offset": 2149, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "68", "infons": {"identifier": "11309", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza", "locations": [{"offset": 3548, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "69", "infons": {"identifier": "41857", "type": "Species"}, "text": "A H1N1", "locations": [{"offset": 2159, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "70", "infons": {"identifier": "41857", "type": "Species"}, "text": "A H1N1", "locations": [{"offset": 3558, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "71", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019", "locations": [{"offset": 1927, "length": 24}]}, {"id": "72", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1953, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "73", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2308, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "74", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011014", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pneumonia", "locations": [{"offset": 2455, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "75", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 2593, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "76", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 2631, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "77", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 2662, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "78", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 3774, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "79", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D005334", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "fever", "locations": [{"offset": 3885, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "80", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011014", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "progressive pneumonia", "locations": [{"offset": 3895, "length": 21}]}, {"id": "81", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 3924, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "82", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 3948, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "83", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 4005, "length": 9}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Introduction"}, "offset": 4379, "text": "In HKSAR, community-wide masking was practiced by the general population at an early stage of the local COVID-19 epidemic.

In effect, these mask-off settings allowed the sharing of their saliva and respiratory droplets, which may contain a viral load of 100 million per ml, directly or indirectly.   In HKSAR hospitals, wearing face masks is mandatory during the pandemic. It is also the practice among many community service providers and those who are working indoors. Since the supply of face mask was tight in the community as well as in the healthcare setting, it is the practice of our general public not to use more than one face mask per person per day. We observed that the overall compliance of face mask usage was 97% in all administrative districts in the morning. Thus we have the reason to believe that their compliance to face mask usage would remain high throughout the day at the workplace.

In particular, our incidence of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of Singapore, a city comparable with HKSAR in terms of area, population density, healthcare infrastructure, BCG vaccination, as well as adopting social distancing strategies and SARS-CoV-2 testing infrastructure. Besides a lower ambient temperature and a higher risk of importation of COVID-19 cases from the mainland which are factors promoting COVID-19 transmission in HKSAR, the most important difference between the two cities is the community-wide usage of face masks in HKSAR but not in Singapore.

WHO issued an interim guideline regarding the use of masks in the context of COVID-19 on 6 April 2020, stating no evidence that wearing a mask by healthy persons in the wider community setting can prevent acquisition of COVID-19. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control issued a technical report on 8 April 2020 that the use of face masks in the community could be considered, especially when visiting busy, closed spaces, despite not knowing how much the use of masks in the community can contribute to a decrease in transmission in addition to the other counter measures. On 3 April 2020, CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. The shift of paradigm from not recommending to promoting the use of face masks was based on the rationale of pre-symptomatic shedding of SARS-Cov-2 and presence of asymptomatic patients with high viral load in the community.   The use of face mask may serve as source control by preventing dispersal of droplets during talking, sneezing, and coughing, and also reduce the risk of environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2. Despite some supporters of WHO recommendation speaking against universal masking in our local medical community, most opinion leaders in the clinical microbiology and infectious disease specialties of HKSAR openly championed this measure for the control of community transmission of COVID-19. Masking is a continuous form of protection to stop the spreading of saliva and respiratory droplets to others or from others, and to the environment or from the environment to the susceptible by hands through touching of nose, mouth and eye. Touching nose and mouth is a subconscious behavior. Hand hygiene is always the cornerstone to prevent transmission of COVID-19 but it is a one-off discontinuous process where hand contamination may occur easily between each alcoholic handrubbing or hand washing. Although we have successfully implemented directly observed hand hygiene (DOHH) by regular delivery of alcohol-based hand rub to conscious hospitalized patients and persons in residential care homes for the elderly before meal and medication rounds, it may be difficult to practice DOHH in the community. Studies have also shown that wearing a mask with frequent hand hygiene significantly reduced transmission of seasonal influenza virus in the community setting. But once the effect of the use of surgical mask was removed, the effect of hand hygiene became insignificant. With the understanding that the supply of face masks should primarily be reserved for usage in healthcare settings, we believe that it is still advisable to encourage people to wear face masks in the public based on the precautionary principles. Moreover, wearing a cloth mask with less filtration efficiency may still be better than no mask at all in communities of high transmission.", "annotations": [{"id": "304", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "persons", "locations": [{"offset": 24232, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "305", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-Cov-2", "locations": [{"offset": 24931, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "306", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 24971, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "307", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 25205, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "308", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 26167, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "309", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "persons", "locations": [{"offset": 26180, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "310", "infons": {"identifier": "11308", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza virus", "locations": [{"offset": 26438, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "311", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 26757, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "312", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000438", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "alcohol", "locations": [{"offset": 26118, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "313", "infons": {"identifier": "-", "type": "Chemical"}, "text": "DOHH", "locations": [{"offset": 26297, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "314", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 24155, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "315", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 24298, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "316", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003371", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "coughing", "locations": [{"offset": 25136, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "317", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003141", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infectious disease", "locations": [{"offset": 25384, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "318", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 25500, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "319", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 25870, "length": 8}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Discussion"}, "offset": 26976, "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible respiratory virus which causes upper and lower respiratory tract infection leading to a high viral load in respiratory secretions and saliva as shown in clinical studies and transmission studies by close contact in animal models.

The compliance of wearing face mask in terms of not touching the external surface of mask or face, and hand hygiene before or after touching the mask cannot be assessed. Third, we cannot count the mask compliance directly for every community settings. Nevertheless, in the absence of effective antiviral and vaccines, the pandemic spread COVID-19 to many countries provide an unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of this non-pharmaceutical control measures.

As of 14 April 2020 (day 82 since the first reported case in Singapore), Singapore government has started to enforce a penalty of 300 Singapore dollar for anyone going out from home without a mask. Further studies on this important non-pharmaceutical control measure are warranted.

There is some evidence of this in our results as the scenarios with the highest acceptance rate were on the edge of our scenario grid both for event size, event duration, and mean serial interval. This may be the result of these scenarios reducing volatility and therefore having narrower distributions of estimated cases. Indeed, we found that R0 estimates were comparable as event size decreased and event duration increased. Expert knowledge relating to the size and duration of the initial event may help clarify this issue. Alternatively, other estimates of R0 may be used to indicate which event size and event duration scenarios are most plausible."}, {"infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Discussion"}, "offset": 16940, "text": "A previous study also looked at varying the event size and the impact that this had on R0 estimates using a branching process . Our work builds on this by also looking at event duration, including reporting delays, and using a different approach to condition on observed cases. For comparable scenarios, our results were similar to those previously published but we found that R0 estimates were highly sensitive to variation in the assumed serial interval, event size, and event duration. We made use of a highly reproducible framework (an R package) and have released all of our code as open-source . This means that this analysis may be repeated - both by the authors and others - as more data becomes available.

Despite the scarcity of data currently available our estimates may be used to rule out some scenarios and to assess the likelihood of others. Our results indicate that it is very unlikely that the infectious agent responsible for the Wuhan outbreak has a R0 of less than 1, unless the size of the transmission event was much greater than currently reported. We also found that a large initial exposure event was likely, combined with a short duration. These scenarios resulted in R0 estimates that are comparable to those estimated during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. However, with the available data we could not identify whether scenarios with a SARS-like or pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval were more likely. As more information becomes available it may be possible to further refine our results and establish the value of R0. Providing clear quantitative information for decision makers on the transmissibility of coronavirus is of clear public health importance.

As a result of these shortages, many health care providers have temporarily used largely untested, improvised PPE (iPPE). Lack of quality control for makeshift PPE and frequent repurposing of used items to conserve supplies increases both the risk of provider infection and nosocomial spread to uninfected patients. One strategy to reduce risk of infection and preserve existing equipment is the implementation of secondary barrier devices placed directly over patients or providers. The authors describe an inexpensive, disposable, positive-pressure head isolation unit that can be rapidly constructed from materials readily available in nearly all health care settings for under five US dollars. The unit was successfully deployed in Taiwan during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and again during the COVID-19 pandemic. The iPPE worn directly by the health care workers (HCWs) can be donned prior to patient contact in the presence of an air source. This strategy may be more protective than a covering placed over the patient in an aerosol-generating environment, which requires the HCW to be in close contact with the patient prior to securing the protective device.", "annotations": [{"id": "13", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 105, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "14", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 613, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 659, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 700, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 814, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D045169", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", "locations": [{"offset": 1112, "length": 33}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D045169", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "SARS", "locations": [{"offset": 1147, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1184, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1283, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1402, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 1503, "length": 7}]}]}], "pmid": 32398188, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1590176224892}, "accessions": ["disease@MESH:D045169", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:C000657245"], "journal": "Prehosp Disaster Med", "year": 2020, "authors": ["Chien LC", "Be\u00ff CK", "Koenig KL"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

Previously, during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Singapore a decade earlier, staff surveillance, such as mandatory temperature monitoring, was part of our healthcare system's containment strategy. However, at the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic, we recognized several key differences. First, unlike SARS, in which fever predominated, fever may not occur in all patients with COVID-19 on initial presentation. Thus, syndromic surveillance had to be expanded beyond temperature monitoring to include respiratory symptoms as well. Additionally, in SARS, relatively few individuals were asymptomatic and most required hospitalization, leading to a significant risk of patient-HCW transmission. However, with SARS-CoV-2, given that a greater proportion of individuals are asymptomatic and well enough to remain in the community, the possibility that HCWs might bring SARS-CoV-2 into the healthcare system from their community contacts was a cause for concern. Indeed, in the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Singapore, community transmission, rather than healthcare-associated transmission, predominated. Our institution adopted a 3-pronged strategy to contain COVID-19 among our hospital workforce: (1) strengthening centralized reporting of HCWs with acute respiratory illness, (2) conducting surveillance for early warning signs of potential clusters, and (3) performing epidemiology investigation and outbreak management when cases of COVID-19 were detected among HCWs.

For case 1, initial epidemiology investigations revealed that a large number of MSWs had been potentially exposed, given that the index case had returned to work after medical leave ended and worked for 5 days prior to returning to the staff clinic and diagnosis, while still having mild symptoms. Hence, the decision was made to place all MSWs in our institution on home isolation (a total of 103 HCWs) for an initial period of 24 hours while awaiting further investigation. Because this occurred on a weekend, the disruption to patient care was initially minimal. Subsequently, activity mapping and exhaustive phone interviews were conducted with all affected HCWs to identify their potential exposure and to determine whether any of them were potentially symptomatic over the preceding 2 weeks. In total, 16 of 103 MSWs (15.5%) reported that they had had ARI symptoms over the preceding 2 weeks. However, only 1 of the MSWs had previously reported to the staff clinic before a case of COVID-19 was confirmed, and an alternative diagnosis of dengue had been made, based on serologic testing. As a result, heat maps did not pick up the presence of a cluster in the medical social services department (Fig. 1). Of the 16 symptomatic HCWs, 11 (68.8%) had had significant unprotected contact with case 1 and were thus at risk. Of the HCWs working in the same and adjacent cubicle as the index case, 4 of 8 (50%) had ARI symptoms. All symptomatic HCWs were recalled to the staff clinic or ED for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Of the 16 symptomatic HCWs evaluated, 1 HCW (case 2) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; the rest were negative. Case 2 worked in the same cubicle as case 1 and sat immediately adjacent, <1 m apart (Fig. 2). They did not socialize outside the work setting. Her onset of symptoms occurred 4 days after case 1 returned to work. Cases 1 and 2 had ~30 minutes of face-to-face conversation per day in the office. Surgical masks were not used in the office but were strictly used for HCW-patient contact. Upon confirmation of case 2, the MSWs were reinterviewed to establish their contact history with case 2; however, because case 2 had presented to the staff clinic at the time of symptom onset, additional contacts were minimal. In total, 49 staff were placed on quarantine (home isolation) based on significant unprotected contact with the 2 cases, constituting 49 of 103 total staff (47.5%) of the medical social services department.

Although almost half of the medical social services department required isolation, our institution did not have to shut down its medical social services department for 2 weeks. We achieved this through an integrated strategy focused on surveillance for early case detection, outbreak investigation and containment, and encouraging compliance with measures for staff protection at the individual level.", "annotations": [{"id": "248", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 23439, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "249", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 23647, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "250", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 23806, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "251", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 23724, "length": 8}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Discussion"}, "offset": 24293, "text": "Individual-level compliance among HCWs is crucial as the first line of defense during an the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

During an ongoing outbreak, HCWs may experience anxiety when reporting absence from work due to illness or perceive an obligation to work, resulting in the phenomenon of \"presenteeism,\" or work attendance despite illness.

Reflecting ongoing community transmission during the prevailing period, most cases acquired infection from the community or from travel; we detected HCW-HCW spread in only 1 case. The COVID-19 situation was unlike our healthcare system's previous experience with SARS, in which spread was largely nosocomial. Although the use of PPE may have helped to prevent patient-HCW transmission, staff surveillance must be vigilant for intrahospital spread occurring outside the usual ward setting, such as office areas and rest areas where HCWs can mingle. Contact among HCWs was shown to be largely assortative in nature; a local study showed that HCWs reported contact with other HCWs of the same type as the next most frequent class of contact after patients. Thus, initial infections may be concentrated among HCWs of the same type after its introduction into a given setting by an infectious HCW, as occurred in our first staff cluster among MSWs. Given that all HCWs are potentially at risk during a period of ongoing community transmission, surveillance needs to be extended to all staff, not just HCWs who are predominantly ward based (eg, doctors and nurses). This surveillance is especially crucial, given that the potential of transmission from HCWs to patients by allied health professionals should not be underestimated. In local studies, allied health professionals had both the longest cumulative contact time and longest contact episode duration with patients.

For clinical staff, good sleep quality not only helps them to work better to treat patients but also maintains optimal immune function to prevent infection. Therefore, sleep quality is an important indicator of health. Also, psychological wellbeing and sleep are affected by many socio-cultural factors. Social support is a significant social factor. Social support refers to the care and support that people feel they get from other people. Adequate social support has previously been reported to have a positive effect on psychological health and sleep function. Also, anxiety is a common negative emotion experienced by medical staff during epidemics of infectious diseases. The COVID-19 epidemic has become a stressor, particularly as this is a new viral infection does not have a vaccine and can only be treated symptomatically at present. Self-efficacy refers to individual judgment on the ability to complete a certain behavior or task.

Firstly, social support reduces anxiety and stress, and improves self-efficacy. Social support can help medical staff reduce anxiety levels, as friends or family members provide social and emotional support and share empathy. Social interactions reduce negative emotions such as anxiety and can improve mood. Currently, with the increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in China, front-line medical staff are required to wear protective masks and protective clothing, which may cause added stress. When medical staff have a wide social network, social support can help to reduce stress by reducing the perception of the threat of stressful events and the physiological response and inappropriate behavior that can result from stress. Social support contributes to improving self-efficacy, leading to more understanding, respect, encouragement, courage, and a sense of professional achievement. Self-efficacy results in increased confidence to do the job well, and when combined with social support, members of the medical profession suffer less from loneliness and might be more optimistic, which improves coping mechanisms when under stress.", "annotations": [{"id": "269", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 17156, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "270", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 17168, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "271", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 17249, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "272", "infons": {"identifier": null, "type": "Disease", "db": null}, "text": "empathy", "locations": [{"offset": 17341, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "273", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 17403, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "274", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 17488, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "275", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 17497, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "276", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 17627, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "277", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 17716, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "278", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 17863, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "279", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 18272, "length": 6}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Discussion"}, "offset": 18280, "text": "Secondly, the combination of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy of medical staff act on their sleep quality. Anxiety affects sleep quality because anxious people often find it difficult to fall asleep and may wake up frequently during sleep. Also, the combination of anxiety with sleep disorders may make it difficult to fall asleep. The fact that stress is closely related to sleep quality has been confirmed by a previous study. Increased stress can increase the levels of vigilance regarding the environment, which will reduce sleep quality. However, self-efficacy is a positive mental state that may enhance sleep quality. People with high self-efficacy can maintain relatively stable emotions even under pressure, and they may experience fewer episodes of night waking, sleep anxiety, and sleep onset delay. Self-efficacy also increases concentration and self-control. Even though all medical staff experience pressure at work, people who have high self-efficacy are able to control their emotions and try to sleep regularly after work. Therefore, with high self-efficacy, medical staff may have good sleep quality. Anxiety has been shown to increase sensitivity to work pressure and the working environment and has a negative effect on self-efficacy because it reduces positive behaviors and initiative.", "annotations": [{"id": "292", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 18435, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "293", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "People", "locations": [{"offset": 18907, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "294", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 19213, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "295", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 18309, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "296", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 18318, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "297", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 18389, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "298", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 18547, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "299", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012893", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "sleep disorders", "locations": [{"offset": 18560, "length": 15}]}, {"id": "300", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 18628, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "301", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D000079225", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "stress", "locations": [{"offset": 18721, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "302", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 19061, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "303", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001007", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Anxiety", "locations": [{"offset": 19401, "length": 7}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Discussion"}, "offset": 19590, "text": "The findings from this study may provide support for the implementation of measures to improve the social support of medical staff during increased demands associated with COVID-19 infection at this time.

Firstly, this was a cross-sectional study with a small sample size, and definitive causal relationships remain to be established. For example, anxiety may increase stress, and stress may increase anxiety. However, anxiety has been shown to result in impaired sleep, and poor sleep quality increases anxiety.

There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronavirus during pregnancy. In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appeared higher in those affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid review to guide health policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy. Data were extracted from relevant papers. This review has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were lacking. RESULTS: From 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 23 relevant studies, all of which were case reports or case series, were identified. From reports of 32 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven (22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No maternal deaths have been reported to date. Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) delivered preterm. There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death. In 25 babies, no cases of vertical transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction after delivery. Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively. SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester. CONCLUSIONS: Serious morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care. Compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition. Preterm delivery affected 47% of women hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK's reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized. Based on this review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their babies. We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their response to COVID-19.", "annotations": [{"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type":

Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.", "annotations": [{"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "coronaviruses", "locations": [{"offset": 141, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "humans", "locations": [{"offset": 193, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012140", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "respiratory illness", "locations": [{"offset": 247, "length": 19}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "694009", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV", "locations": [{"offset": 274, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 377, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "humans", "locations": [{"offset": 550, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D015047", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "zoonotic", "locations": [{"offset": 614, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "694002", "type": "Species"}, "text": "betacoronaviruses", "locations": [{"offset": 698, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "694009", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV", "locations": [{"offset": 725, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 749, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 1029, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "30", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 1155, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "31", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 1185, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "32", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 1191, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "33", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1238, "length": 10}]}]}], "pmid": 32094589, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1587181047244}, "accessions": ["species@694009", "species@9606", "disease@MESH:D012140", "gene@59272", "species@694002", "disease@MESH:D015047", "species@11118", "species@2697049"], "journal": "Nat Microbiol. 2020 Apr", "year": 2020, "authors": ["Letko M", "Marzi A", "Munster V"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

The French Society of Rheumatology (SFR) selected the most critical ones to the daily practice of a rheumatologist and a group of 10 experts from SFR and Club Rheumatism and Inflammation (CRI) boards proposed responses based on the current knowledge of May 2020. BASIC PROCEDURE: Following the availability of the first 18 questions and statements, 1400 individuals consulted the frequently asked questions between the March 31, 2020 and April 12, 2020. As a result, 16 additional questions were forwarded to the SFR, and answered by the board. An additional round of review by email and video conference was organized, which included updates of the previous statements. The scientific relevance of 5 of the questions led to their inclusion in this document. Each response received a final assessment on a scale of 0-10 with 0 meaning no agreement whatsoever and 10 being in complete agreement. The mean values of these votes for each question are presented as the levels of agreement (LoA) at the end of each response. This document was last updated on April 17, 2020. MAIN FINDINGS: Based on current scientific literature already published, in most circumstances, there is no contraindication to the initiation or continuation of anti-inflammatory drugs as well as DMARDs. If signs suggestive of infection (coronavirus or other) occurs, treatments should be discontinued and resumed, if necessary, after 2 weeks without any symptoms. Only, some signals suggest that people taking an immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroid therapy are at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19. Intra-articular injections of glucocorticoids are allowed when there is no reasonable therapeutic alternative, and providing that precautions to protect the patient and the practitioner from viral contamination are adopted, included appropriate information to the patient. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: Currently available data on managing patients with rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic are reassuring and support continuing or initiating symptomatic as well as specific treatments of these diseases, the main target of their management remaining their appropriate control, even during this pandemic.", "annotations": [{"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 212, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 257, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007249", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Club Rheumatism and Inflammation", "locations": [{"offset": 551, "length": 32}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1695, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 1706, "length": 11}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 1865, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1972, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 2139, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "26", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patient", "locations": [{"offset": 2246, "length": 7}]}, {"id": "27", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2315, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "28", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012216", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "rheumatic diseases", "locations": [{"offset": 2329, "length": 18}]}, {"id": "29", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 2359, "length": 8}]}]}], "pmid": 32473418, "pmcid": null, "created": {"$date": 1591021985941}, "accessions": ["species@9606", "disease@MESH:C000657245", "disease@MESH:D007239", "disease@MESH:D012216", "species@11118", "disease@MESH:D007249"], "journal": "Joint Bone Spine", "year": 2020, "authors": ["Richez C", "Flipo RM", "Berenbaum F", "Cantagrel A", "Claudepierre P", "Debiais F", "Dieud\u00e9 P", "Goupille P", "Roux C", "Schaeverbeke T", "Wendling D", "Pham T", "Thomas T"], "tags": ["LitCovid"]}

As conjunctivitis is a common eye condition, ophthalmologists may be the first medical professionals to evaluate a patient with COVID-19.

Second, the need to create an epidemiological/clinical assessment protocol (triage) to classify patients based on medical history, geographical origin (i.e. inside or outside the cluster zones), and clinical signs such as fever, persisting cough for more than 48-72 h, dyspnea, SaO2<93% when breathing air. Third, the need to develop a diagnostic algorithm to determine which tests to perform when, i.e. pharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2, chest X-ray or pulmonary high-resolution CT. The proposed triage led to the identification of four patient categories: green (SaO2>94%, RR<20 breaths min-1); yellow (SaO2<94%, RR>20 but responds to oxygen 10-15 L min-1); orange (SaO2<94%, RR 25-30 but poor response to oxygen 10-15 L min-1 and needing continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP]/noninvasive ventilation [NIV] with FiO2<50%;red (SaO2<94%, RR>30 but poor response to oxygen 10-15 L min-1, CPAP/NIV with FiO2>50% or presenting respiratory distress with PaO2/FiO2<200 and needing endotracheal intubation [EI] and ICU admission). The actions requested concerned indications for the transfer of suspected or confirmed cases, depending on the local situation, to one of the following: 1) ad-hoc so-called COVID HUB hospitals (i.e. special units inside or outside the hospital dedicated to these patients and developed, on average, within or shortly after the first week from the initial outbreak); 2) infectious disease units, or dedicated areas ready for isolation of confirmed cases and immediate ARF treatment; or 3) ICU for early intubation of compromised patients with low PaO2/FiO2 or patients \"not responding\" to oxygen/CPAP/NIV. The Consensus focused on a \"what to do\" management pathway (see flow chart, fig. 1) stressing the need for close patient monitoring, care of comorbidities, fluid and nutritional prescription, sedation if needed, use of aerosol devices if needed, and monitoring for risk of a sudden deterioration of the patient's clinical conditions. It discussed the indications for high-flow oxygen blender, level of FiO2 to guarantee just an SaO2>90%, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) devices, and CPAP/NIV indications as a form of treatment or as ceiling of treatment and palliative care. After extensive discussion, the Consensus set the indication for CPAP between 10 and 12 cmH20, without humidification and with helmet (first choice), for CPAP use with a mask (second choice) and for NIV use with an oronasal face mask (third choice), using high performance ventilators or, if these are lacking, dedicated NIV platforms or home ventilators. Due to the non sufficient number of ICU beds, respiratory intermediate units and negative pressure rooms to provide the respiratory support to all the patients, Consensus proposed Emergency Room, medical wards, dedicated units and surgical rooms had to be transformed in locations to provide any form of mechanical ventilationin rooms with possibility of air exchange (big windows to open periodicallyachieving a change of air of at least 160 L h-1, as recommended). Clearly when all these environments are unavailable, CPAP/NIV is indicated using the maximum available personnel protection. Indications when to stop CPAP/NIV in case of worsening did not reach a consensus amongst the audit group, nor did standardised indications for when to perform intubation, as this depends on the number of beds of the referral ICU and their actual occupancy. Obviously, the group suggested a regular decontamination of the ventilator and devices used, at the end of the ventilator treatment. Due to uncertainty around the potential for aerosolization, HFO, NIV, including bubble CPAP, we have further stressed the need for airborne precautions. Consensus stressed also that, in the de novo severe critical patients and in patients failing 2 h of CPAP/NIV, the GOLD standard remains the ICU admission. Otherwise, in a \"war\" condition like our with an huge numbers of patients, paucity of ICU beds and ventilators the option of CPAP/NIV administered non invasively remains the unique change. The Consensus was not focused on the role of antiviral, antibiotics, steroids, anticoagulant and others innovative drugs because this topic was not strictly related to the consensus object. Regarding organisation, pulmonologists have been involved in identifying: a) hospitals or hospital areas for isolated suspect patients awaiting confirmation of diagnosis; b) specific \"contaminated\" paths, zones and the team involved; c) transferal procedures for patients into negative aeration rooms (when available) or, as second choice, into one-bed rooms or an area with a distance of at least 2 m between patients. The work in these days has led to the creation of isolation areas for patient groups (positive and on EI; positive on NIV/CPAP; positive with respiratory failure on oxygen therapy; negative pending the second pharyngeal swab if the clinic and CT scan suggest bilateral and interstitial pneumonia). The respiratory team has had to manage and co-manage patients with other specialists in the multidisciplinary team with maximal flexibility to find discharge routes to \"intermediate\" units (such as Internal Medicine, Respiratory Rehabilitation, Social Units) for COVID patients with further need of clinical and infective follow-up. The Consensus agreed to abolish visits by family members to COVID patients, offering once a day a face-to-face contact or a telephone call with one family member only. Since the first days of the crisis, our teams have been involved in sharing ceiling treatment decisions for EI and CPAP/NIV use based on the patient's medical history, age, beds available and numbers of new cases. Finally, all our staff has been strongly exhorted to use adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) according to the WHO document, equipment that, up till now, remains not easy to find due to the huge demand.

Moreover, more genomic data will be fundamental to shed light on the epidemiological dynamics of the virus in the country helping to understand how the virus is spreading both around the world and thought time. More genomic surveillance efforts during epidemics should be undertaken to provide enough data to make reliable inferences on the molecular epidemiology of the rapidly evolving virus. Phylogenetic inference robustness will be improved if other genomic sequences will be available to build an even more informative dataset despite the low heterogeneity of the sequenced strains. Consequently, this analysis has to be considered as the first preliminary report regarding the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy that highlights two independent introductions probably mediated by China and Germany, respectively.

First, there is a need to refine existing screening instruments with translation, validation, and cross-cultural adaptation without detracting from their psychometric properties to boost clinical and epidemiological research across the world. Also, future validation studies should include the elderly, children, adolescents, young adults, and people with pre-existing physical and mental illness in particular settings (e.g. isolation, quarantine), to determine the discriminative ability and widen their utility. Second, researchers need to compare the psychometric properties of these scales with each other or with traditional scales (e.g. PHQ-9, GAD-7) to ascertain the optimal measure in different countries, settings, and populations. However, these scales may be useful for epidemiological research, but perhaps not for interventional studies that need additional scales as outcome measures. For interventional research, the combination of scales or tools (e.g. traditional, self-report, and clinical-administered) either parallel or in a predefined sequence may be necessary to assess the change and to improve diagnostic coverage, psychometric properties, and comparative evaluation.

However, current estimates of case fatality ratio for COVID-19 vary depending on the datasets and time periods examined.

By using individual-case data from mainland China (3665 cases) and 1334 cases detected outside of mainland China, assuming a constant attack rate by age, and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment, Verity and colleagues estimate the mean duration from symptom onset to death to be 17 8 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 16 9-19 2) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 24 7 days (22 9-28 1).

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1-31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naive countries.", "annotations": [{"id": "15", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "Novel Coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 122, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "16", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 141, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "17", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-COV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 152, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "18", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "humans", "locations": [{"offset": 181, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "19", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 401, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "20", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 419, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "21", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 833, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "22", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 1309, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "23", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 1754, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "24", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D018352", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Coronavirus-infected pneumonia", "locations": [{"offset": 1501, "length": 30}]}, {"id": "25", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1533, "length": 8}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1", "section": "Introduction"}, "offset": 2746, "text": "Introduction"}, {"infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Introduction"}, "offset": 2759, "text": "On 31 December 2019, local hospitals in Wuhan, China reported that they had detected a series of cases of Novel Coronavirus-infected pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Thus countries with a higher number of passengers travelling from any of these cities had a higher risk of transmission. We then weighted the risk estimated for each city with the number of reported infected people in each city by 31 January 2020 and estimated the mean average risk of transmission termed as 'Risk index' which follows the equation below:where x is the destination country, Risk index (x) is the risk of infection importation in country x, P(x)n is the number of passengers to country x from city n, Pn is the total number of passengers who left city n, In is the number of infected people in city n and Cn is the population size of city n. The risk index denotes the risk of at least one case being imported into a country or territory where 1 means an absolute certainty and 0 means no risk at all.

This is achieved by appropriate actions at high-risk points of departure and at highly used ports of entry from these infected zones. Closure of certain routes, targeted airport screening, risk communication, public awareness and targeted training and vigilance of health workers associated with the portals of entry of visitors to their countries will help mitigate the force of further spread of 2019-nCoV.", "annotations": [{"id": "162", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-COV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 22740, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "163", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 23189, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "164", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "people", "locations": [{"offset": 23263, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "165", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 23479, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "166", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-COV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 23490, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "167", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "human", "locations": [{"offset": 23510, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "168", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 23922, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "169", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 23642, "length": 8}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "title", "section": "References"}, "offset": 23933, "text": "References"}, {"infons": {"section_type": "REF", "name_0": "surname:Li;given-names:Q", "fpage": "1", "pub-id_pmid": "31826359", "year": "2020", "source": "The New England Journal of Medicine", "type": "ref", "lpage": "9", "section": "References"}, "offset": 23944, "text": "Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia", "annotations": [{"id": "171", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia", "locations": [{"offset": 23992, "length": 36}]}]}, {"infons": {"volume": "6736", "section_type": "REF", "name_0": "surname:Chen;given-names:N", "fpage": "1", "year": "2020", "source": "Lancet (London, England)", "type": "ref", "lpage": "7", "section": "References"}, "offset": 24029, "text": "Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study", "annotations": [{"id": "173", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "novel coronavirus pneumonia", "locations": [{"offset": 24094, "length": 27}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "REF", "year": "2020", "type": "ref", "section": "References"}, "offset": 24159, "text": ""}, {"infons": {"name_2": "surname:Leung;given-names:GM", "name_1": "surname:Leung;given-names:K", "section_type": "REF", "name_0": "surname:Wu;given-names:JT", "fpage": "6736", "pub-id_doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30260-9", "year": "2020", "source": "The Lancet", "type": "ref", "section": "References"}, "offset": 24160, "text": "Nowcasting and forecasting the potential domestic and international spread of the 2019-nCoV outbreak originating in Wuhan, China: a modelling study", "annotations": [{"id": "175", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "2019-nCoV", "locations": [{"offset": 24242, "length": 9}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "REF", "name_0": "surname:Bogoch;given-names:II", "pub-id_doi": "10.1093/jtm/taaa011", "year": "2020", "source": "Journal of Travel Medicine", "type": "ref", "section": "References"}, "offset": 24308, "text": "Potential for global spread of a novel coronavirus from China", "annotations": [{"id": "177", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "novel coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 24341, "length": 17}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "REF", "type": "ref", "section": "References"}, "offset": 24370, "text": ".

If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid-19 because its male smoking rate is over 60% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses. Smoking can upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the human respiratory coronavirus NL638. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and \"heat-not-burn\" IQOS devices. ACE2 could be a novel adhesion molecule for SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation.

Smokers contract more respiratory ailments, including colds (commonly rhinoviruses, but also coronaviruses) than non-smokers. Smokers also show double the influenza rate and increased rates of bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis. The damage caused to the lungs by smoking makes patients more susceptible to pulmonary infections, both bacterial and viral. Smokers are 34% more likely than non-smokers to contract the flu. Han and colleagues conclude that literature evidence showed that smoking was consistently associated with a higher risk of hospital admissions after influenza infection. Smoking is the primary etiological factor behind chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the developed world, but environmental pollution and degrading air quality are also responsible in developing countries. It is now the fourth leading cause of death in the world. Vaccination against influenza is strongly recommended for patients with COPD, as the frequency and progression of exacerbations are strongly linked to respiratory viruses in 30% of cases. Rubin et al. found that COPD patients who were prone to viral infections had higher exacerbation rates, more inflammation, and loss of lung function compared to those with existing exacerbating disease conditions. Symptomatology and mortality in influenza-infected smokers were also enhanced. According to the WHO, comorbidities are associated with a high percentage of Covid-19 related deaths. In conjunction with the complications arising from comorbidities in patients who smoke, we put forth the question of whether smoking, smoking-induced health conditions, and comorbidities, in combination, is culminating in a high risk demographic for both contraction of the virus and the severe presentation of Covid-19.", "annotations": [{"id": "64", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "novel coronavirus", "locations": [{"offset": 1464, "length": 17}]}, {"id": "65", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", "locations": [{"offset": 1483, "length": 47}]}, {"id": "66", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1532, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "67", "infons": {"identifier": "11118", "type": "Species"}, "text": "coronaviruses", "locations": [{"offset": 1711, "length": 13}]}, {"id": "68", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 1897, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "69", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2544, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "70", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 2703, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "71", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 3137, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "72", "infons": {"identifier": "11308", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza", "locations": [{"offset": 1773, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "73", "infons": {"identifier": "11308", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza", "locations": [{"offset": 2189, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "74", "infons": {"identifier": "11308", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza", "locations": [{"offset": 2506, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "75", "infons": {"identifier": "11308", "type": "Species"}, "text": "influenza", "locations": [{"offset": 2920, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "76", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 1561, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "77", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1579, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "78", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D011014", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pneumonia", "locations": [{"offset": 1821, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "79", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D014376", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "tuberculosis", "locations": [{"offset": 1835, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "80", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012141", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "pulmonary infections", "locations": [{"offset": 1926, "length": 20}]}, {"id": "81", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 2199, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "82", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D029424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "locations": [{"offset": 2259, "length": 37}]}, {"id": "83", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D029424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COPD", "locations": [{"offset": 2298, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "84", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "death", "locations": [{"offset": 2466, "length": 5}]}, {"id": "85", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D029424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COPD", "locations": [{"offset": 2558, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "86", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D029424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COPD", "locations": [{"offset": 2698, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "87", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D001102", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "viral infections", "locations": [{"offset": 2730, "length": 16}]}, {"id": "88", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007249", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "inflammation", "locations": [{"offset": 2783, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "89", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "mortality", "locations": [{"offset": 2907, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "90", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infected", "locations": [{"offset": 2930, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "91", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 3044, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "92", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D003643", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "deaths", "locations": [{"offset": 3061, "length": 6}]}, {"id": "93", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 3380, "length": 8}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Abstract"}, "offset": 3390, "text": "China has a high male smoking rate at around 50% in rural areas and is estimated to be about 44.8% overall.

Guoshuai Cai recently reported higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to never-smokers. Zhao et al. observed that ACE2 is expressed explicitly in type-2 pneumocytes, in which genes regulating viral reproduction and transmission are highly expressed. This indicates that smokers may be more susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2, and possibly Covid-19. We recently identified enhanced ACE2 expression in resected lung tissue from patients with COPD and healthy lung function smokers, albeit comparably less in the latter, while entirely absent in heathy non-smoking individuals (Figure 1). ACE2 expression was quite evident in the type-2 pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and the apical end of the small airway epithelium. COPD patients showed significantly higher levels of ACE2, suggesting that COPD further exaggerates ACE2 and potential SARS-CoV-2 adhesion site. ACE2 expression could also be true for patients with another chronic lung disease such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The attachment of the virus to cell surface ACE2 protects them from immune surveillance mechanisms, leaving them tagged to the host for relatively longer periods, thus making them an efficient carrier and vulnerable host for future infections and spread. The eventual engulfment of ACE2 further provides the virus access to the host cells system, thus providing a flourishing environment, not just to sustain and proliferate but also to mutate and modify host evasion mechanisms. Previous observations using in vivo knockout mice models suggest that SARS-CoV-2 adhesion on ACE2 could also downmodulate the expression of ACE2 itself. This, in turn, increases the production and activation of other related ACE enzymes. This differential modulation and the drastic reduction in ACE2 results in severe acute respiratory failure.", "annotations": [{"id": "206", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 6469, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "207", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 6564, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "208", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 6656, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "209", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 6927, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "210", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 7132, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "211", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 7318, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "212", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 7365, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "213", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 7410, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "214", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 7575, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "215", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 7813, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "216", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 8104, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "217", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 8151, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "218", "infons": {"identifier": "1636", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "37351"}, "text": "ACE", "locations": [{"offset": 8236, "length": 3}]}, {"id": "219", "infons": {"identifier": "59272", "type": "Gene", "ncbi_homologene": "41448"}, "text": "ACE2", "locations": [{"offset": 8307, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "220", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 6860, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "221", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 6972, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "222", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 7271, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "223", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 7384, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "224", "infons": {"identifier": "9606", "type": "Species"}, "text": "patients", "locations": [{"offset": 7449, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "225", "infons": {"identifier": "10090", "type": "Species"}, "text": "mice", "locations": [{"offset": 8056, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "226", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 8081, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "227", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 6847, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "228", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "Covid-19", "locations": [{"offset": 6885, "length": 8}]}, {"id": "229", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D029424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COPD", "locations": [{"offset": 6986, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "230", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D029424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COPD", "locations": [{"offset": 7266, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "231", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D029424", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COPD", "locations": [{"offset": 7340, "length": 4}]}, {"id": "232", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D008171", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "lung disease", "locations": [{"offset": 7479, "length": 12}]}, {"id": "233", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D054990", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "locations": [{"offset": 7500, "length": 29}]}, {"id": "234", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infections", "locations": [{"offset": 7763, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "235", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D012131", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "respiratory failure", "locations": [{"offset": 8336, "length": 19}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Abstract"}, "offset": 8357, "text": "Wang et al. also noted an ACE2 connection to smoking and Covid-19.

Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these issues have focused attention on how these resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies, for example, misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion, which disfavors older adults in resource allocation decisions. This is a companion manuscript to the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) position statement, \"Resource Allocation Strategies and Age-Related Considerations in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond.\" It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations that should be considered when developing strategies for allocation of scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults. This review presents the legal and ethical background for the position statement and discusses the following issues that informed the development of the AGS positions: (1) age as a determining factor; (2) age as a tiebreaker; (3) criteria with a differential impact on older adults; (4) individual choices and advance directives; (5) racial/ethnic disparities and resource allocation; and (6) scoring systems and their impact on older adults. It also considers the role of advance directives as expressions of individual preferences in pandemics. This article is protected by copyright.

Among nucleic acid tests, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method is considered as the 'gold standard' for the detection of some viruses and is characterized by rapid detection, high sensitivity, and specificity. As such, real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is of great interest today for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 due to its benefits as a specific and simple qualitative assay. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR has adequate sensitivity to help us much for diagnosing early infection. Therefore, the 'criterion-referenced' real-time RT-PCR assay can be considered as a main method to be applied to detect the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2.", "annotations": [{"id": "34", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1335, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "35", "infons": {"identifier": "2697049", "type": "Species"}, "text": "SARS-CoV-2", "locations": [{"offset": 1663, "length": 10}]}, {"id": "36", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:D007239", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "infection", "locations": [{"offset": 1499, "length": 9}]}, {"id": "37", "infons": {"identifier": "MESH:C000657245", "type": "Disease"}, "text": "COVID-19", "locations": [{"offset": 1653, "length": 8}]}]}, {"infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph", "section": "Title"}, "offset": 1686, "text": "An important issue with the real-time RT-PCR test is the risk of eliciting false-negative and false-positive results.

Thus, a negative result does not exclude the possibility of COVID-19 infection and should not be used as the only criterion for treatment or patient management decisions. It seems that combination of real-time RT-PCR and clinical features facilitates management of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Several factors have been proposed to be associated with the inconsistency of real-time RT-PCR.

Although it was attempted to design the real-time RT-PCR assay as precisely as possible based on the conserved regions of the viral genomes, variability causing mismatches between the primers and probes and the target sequences can lead to decrease in assay performance and potential false-negative results. In this regard, multiple target gene amplification could be used to avoid invalid results. Several types of SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR kit have been developed and approved rapidly, but with different quality.

While BALF samples are not practical for the routine laboratory diagnosis and monitoring of the disease, collection of other samples such as sputum, nasal swab, and throat swab is rapid, simple, and safe. To avoid inconsistent results, it would be better to use different specimen types (stool and blood) besides respiratory specimen during different stages.
